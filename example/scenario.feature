  @seventh @comments
  Scenario: Scenario with comments and a description
    There once was a need for information to be displayed alongside all the
    entities that I hoped to test
    # First Comment
    Given this first step
    # Second Comment that
    # spans a few lines
    And this second step
    # Third Comment
    And this third step
    # Comments after the last step, where do they go?

  Scenario: Step ending with a match with double-quotes
    When searching the log for the exact match of the message "Entering application."
    When the step definition has HTML escaped characters like: "<>&"

  Scenario: Steps defined with a common block
    This scenario executes several steps that were all created
    with a common proc. This is useful when writing a process 
    that is then aliased for multiple languages. The english 
    keyword has been used as a constant here as that is a
    different feature
